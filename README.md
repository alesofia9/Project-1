## Description
Have you ever needed a way to create a unique name to name a building, a job, a title of a project, or simply to name a new baby, but all you end up coming up with is the same name over and over again? Well have no fear, our new project is designed to fix that just issue. Now with a click of a button you to can be given a string of 10 (yes that is correct, 10) unique names. You may aso be thinking even thought that was pretty easy to do we have also created a second button that allows you to get a digital fortune cookie of inspirational quotes by all types of people on earth, even some that are not on earth. The purpose of this application is to provide users with a creative and fun way to come up with great quotes, what we call in the bizz (DIGITAL FORTUNE COOKIES.) as well as unique names to use for your next baby and or other thing that may be just as important as a baby.
